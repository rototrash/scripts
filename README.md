# simple-automation-scripts
Real simple scripts to automate some of my simple tasks cuz I'm lazy to do it everytime I break my linux install :)

## 1. Copy Bluetooth Pairing Info File from Manjaro to Arcolinux and EndeavourOS.

### Usage

Run the `db-bt-pair.sh` file as `su`, `sudo` won't work here.
```
$ su
Password:
# sh db-bt-pair.sh
```
